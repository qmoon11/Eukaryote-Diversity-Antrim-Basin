# Eukaryote-Diversity-Antrim-Basin
Project Overview:

This project investigates how eukaryotic microbial communities, with a focus on fungi, vary across depth and salinity gradients in the deep subsurface of the Antrim Basin. We analyze sequencing data alongside geochemical metadata to understand how eukaryote composition influences carbon cycling.

Repository Contents:

R scripts: For processing sequencing data, taxonomy assignment, normalization, and visualization.

SLURM scripts: Linux job submission scripts that run R and Python analyses on HPC clusters.

Data files: OTU tables, taxonomy assignments, and environmental metadata.
